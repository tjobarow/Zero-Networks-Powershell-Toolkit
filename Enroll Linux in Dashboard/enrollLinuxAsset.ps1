.Synopsis
   This script accepts a CSV of Linux servers, and adds them to the Zero Networks dashboard as a manual Linux asset. 
   
.DESCRIPTION
   This script does the following:
   - Reads a list of Linux hostnames from a CSV file named linx-assets.csv
   - Normalizes all hostnames to include your company domain at the end - this is incase some hostnames do not have trailing domain in CSV
        - e.g.: linuxserver gets correct to linuxserver.company.com
        - YOU MUST UPDATE THE STRING ON LINES 67 & 72 TO MATCH YOUR COMPANY DOMAIN
   - Makes a REST API call to Zero Networks to enroll the Linux host as a manual Linux asset. 
        - The displayName and FQDN parameters of the API call are the same value - the full FQDN of the linux host (linuxserver.company.com)
        - The API token is read from a text file, named token.txt - you must create this file for the API call to succeed
    - This information is logged to a .log file, including the asset ID returned from the API

.EXAMPLE
   Update .csv to contain contains several hostnames of linux servers: 
   testserver1.company.com
   testserver2
   testserver3

   (It doesn't matter whether you put the domain or not, as long as you have updated the domain on lines 67 & 72 )

   The script will then run, read the contents of the CSV, and add them to Zero Networks. The output will be logged to the console, as well
   as a log file named "<%Y-%m-$d>-enroll-linux-script.log" (where <%Y-%m-$d> is the current Year-Month-Day)

.INPUTS
    - File named "linux-assets.csv" that lives in the same directory as the script is ran from
    - Text file named "token.txt" which contains your dashboard API token

.OUTPUTS
   Log file named "<%Y-%m-$d>-enroll-linux-script.log" (where <%Y-%m-$d> is the current Year-Month-Day)

.NOTES
   Make sure to update the string to match your company's domain on lines 67 & 72

<#
The way we generated an inventory of linux servers means some of the hostnames in the loaded CSV have our domain at the end, while others do not.
Our goal is to have the hosts sent to ZN in the format of <hostname>@<domain>.com
#>

#So for each hostname from the CSV
foreach ($hostname in $hostCsvObj){
    #If the hostname is attached, save it to $hostFixed variable w/o doing anything.
    if ( ($hostname).HostName -match ".company.com") {
        $hostFixed = ($hostname).HostName
    }
    #Else if it doesn't already have the domain, add the domain to the end
    else {
        $hostfixed = "$(($hostname).HostName).company.com"
    }
    #And add this normalized hostname to the $hostList 
    $hostList += $hostFixed

Set up params for the API call.

This is NOT just query parameters, but is actually a hashtable of all parameters to pass to Invoke-RestMethod

$params = @{
    Uri="https://portal.zeronetworks.com/api/v1/assets/linux"
    Method="Post"
    Headers=@{
        #The API token is stored in a text file named "token.txt"
        "Authorization"="$(Get-Content -Path .\token.txt)"
        "Accept"="application/json"
        "Content-Type"="application/json"
    }
}

<#
For each Linux host in the host list, we construct the request body using a hashtable, and then use Invoke-RestMethod to add the Linux host to ZN

A try/catch is used in case the web request fails for whatever reason. Invoke-WebRequest should (per my understanding) count certain HTTP status codes
(such as 404) as errors and throw an exception. There is no real handling besides printing and logging that failure.
