.Synopsis
   This script accepts a CSV of remote Windows servers, and runs several command useful for forcing GPO processing
   
.DESCRIPTION
   This script accepts a CSV list of remote Windows servers which have been added to the "ZNMonitoredAssets" AD group
   and uses the cmdlet "Invoke-Command" to remotely clear the each servers Kerberos ticket, and force a group policy
   update. It uses "jobs" inside of "Invoke-Command" in order to asynchronously run these commands on all listed servers.
   When all jobs are complete, this script will retrieve all job results, and print/log them to the user for verification. 
   The script requires the user to provide valid credentials for a domain account with permissions to make remote calls
   to the servers in the provided hosts.csv file. 

   Since the Kerberos ticket on a server contains group membership information, until the ticket refreshes, the asset will 
   not process the ZerNetworksMonitoredAssets GPO, and thus will not send firewall event logs to ZN. This script force refreshes the
   ticket, and then forces a group policy update. This significantly can speed up the time it takes for an asset to appear
   as monitored, and send data to ZN. 

.EXAMPLE
   Update Hosts.csv to contain contains several hostnames of windows servers: 
   testserver1
   testserver2
   testserver3

   (may need to add full FQDN depending on environment)

   The script will read these FQDNs from hosts.csv, and then start job on each server to run the following commands:
        klist -li 0x3e4 purge
        klist -li 0x3e7 purge
        gpupdate /force
    
    After all jobs are complete, the user can see the output of each job, for example:
        2023-02-02 2023 23:05:03: Running commands on winserver1 succeeded with the following output...

        Current LogonId is 0:0x9d83b571
        Targeted LogonId is 0:0x3e4
            Deleting all tickets:
            Ticket(s) purged!

        Current LogonId is 0:0x9d83b571
        Targeted LogonId is 0:0x3e7
            Deleting all tickets:
            Ticket(s) purged!
        Updating policy...



        Computer Policy update has completed successfully.

        User Policy update has completed successfully.

    This information is written to the console, as well as a log file named "<%Y-%m-$d>-zn-klist-purge.log"

.INPUTS
    - File named "hosts.csv" that lives in the same directory as the script is ran from
    - Credentials for a domain account that has WinRM permissions on the remote server

.OUTPUTS
   Log file named "<%Y-%m-$d>-zn-klist-purge.log"

.NOTES
   Make sure the supplied domain account has permissions to invoke remote commands on the servers. The servers themselves should also have WinRM enabled,
   and be able to accept remote commands.
